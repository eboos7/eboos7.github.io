During my first year out of college, I declined job offers from Fortune 500 companies and venture-backed startups to go out and try something on my own.

I opted to take a gap year after graduating to rapidly test many different industries to see which I liked working in best. Specifically, I started a software implementation consultancy.

As a fresh grad out of college with entry level technical skills work was initially hard to come by. I initially pitched startups performance-based work and slowly grew my client base.

The work was largely configuring out-of-the-box software. Some projects were large scale integrations of multiple software platforms, others were small web scraping projects. I grew the business to have employees across the world: South Africa, Philippines, and Greece with clients in industries ranging from software development, banking, recruiting, oil & gas, infoproducts, and many more. In total, I had over 20 clients, topping $100,000 in revenue.

I knew the business was not sustainable over the long term because after I would solve a client’s problems they wouldn’t need my services anymore, putting me in a constant state of client churn.

As I shut down the company after a year of hard work and service I was ecstatic. I had a whole new frame of how businesses actually operate, what type of jobs have high turnover/burnout, what industries have the best prospects for career growth, and knew exactly what I wanted to do.

My gap year taught me that I have two raw, deep-seated career drives:
1. Learning cutting edge technology
2. Building wealth through SMB/Real Estate involvement

After closing my consulting company, I began building a career around my drives. 

I enrolled full-time in Georgia Tech's Masters of Computer Science program, and plan on continuing with a PhD in Robotics. Georgia Tech has a suprising amount of opportunities to work full-time, making above average pay, and chip away at fully-funded continuing education. As of summer 2024, I am halfway done with the masters program and am working in a Georgia Tech lab as a researcher. I found my sweet spot for drive #1.

To scratch my itch of drive #2 I completed a variety of different programs: Georgia Real Estate License, [Real Estate Financial Modelling](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/self-study-programs/real-estate-financial-modeling/), and [Business Acquisition](https://acquisitionlab.com/). After completing these courses, I knew that I wanted to be involved in business brokerage. Business brokers not only get to see the in's and out's of a huge variety of businesses, but also achieve big paydays depending on performance. I'm currently meeting with different brokerages for part-time work. I'm close to finding my sweet spot for drive #2.
