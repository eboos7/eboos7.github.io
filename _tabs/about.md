Hi, I'm Ethan.

I work as a researcher and graduate student Georgia Tech focusing on the intersection of artificial intelligence and human interaction in robotics. 

I have implemented & configured custom software solutions for 20+ companies, directly impacting thousands of internal employees and tens of thousands of client customers.

Outside of my research role, I broker small business sales ranging from $500k to $10 million.

Grew up in Georgia. Graduated in Applied Math at the University of Georgia.
