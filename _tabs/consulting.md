I used to charged businesses thousands of dollars for my consulting workshops. Now I do 1 day events **for free**. 

Why are my events free?

[If you read my bio](https://www.ethanboos.com/about), you know I broker business sales. I consult for free because I know if I get a chance to work with business owners and add real value that I will be top of mind when it comes to assisting with business exits or acquisitions.

My consulting specialties are:
- Digital Transformation - Integrating technology to make everything run smoother and smarter.
- Lean Operational Toolkit - Finding and fixing problems while getting rid of blockers that slows things down.
- Commercial Excellence - Nailing every aspect of how a company sells and serves its customers.
- Outsourcing - Hiring talented people at a fraction of the US-based cost.
